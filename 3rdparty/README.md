# 3rd party folder

This folder is where we keep third-party resources. In particular, we clone the [C3D repo](https://github.com/facebook/C3D), leveraging C3D v1.0 as the basis for the SST visual encoder. You may also wish to include any third party repositories for action classification (on top of the proposals) in this folder.

Be sure to cite the appropriate 3rd party repositories/papers as well if you utilize them.
